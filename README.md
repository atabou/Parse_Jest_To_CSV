# Parse_Jest_To_CSV

Script to convert a Javascript Jest Test file to a csv compatible with Target Process.

This script is not perfect, however, it works for my current purposes. I will probably continue to update it as new needs come along.

For now it works in the following way:

1- Run `python parseJestToTest.py`
2- Input the path to your test file
3- Input the name of the method from which you want to extract the tests.
4- Input the name of the Output file (It would be easier if you attach .csv at the end of the output file name)
